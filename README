This extension show the time remaining of your battery near the icon. 
It shows the time remaining to full discharge when unplugged and the time to 
full charge when plugged to AC.

There is a first attempt to manage multiple batteries, but I don't know if 
it works because my laptop has only one.

There are other options available, look under here in *SETTINGS*

Please report any bug and issue to 
        https://github.com/Der-Schubi/battery-remaining-time/issues
or, if you prefer by mail to

*SETTINGS*
All the settings are now update to gsettings and are 
configurable via the gnome-shell-extension-prefs.

They are 6.
_Show the arrow_
If true show the arrow near the text when charging. (default: ON)

_Show the percentage_
If true show the percentage near the time. (default: ON)

_Show when charging._
If true show the remaining time when charging. (default: ON)

_Show when full_
If true show when full. (default: ON)

_Show the icon. Needs reload_
If true show the icon near the text. (default: ON)
Unfortunately, needs reload to show the icon again after disabling it.

_Debug mode. Needs reload_
If true show debug messages in Looking Glass. (default: OFF)
This needs reload because some debug messages are shown before settings.


*Credits*
This extension was primary written by Davide Alberelli and later transfered to me.
It was once based on the battery-percentage-indicator
extension by paravoid.
In time a lot of code was borrowed from some other extensions.
